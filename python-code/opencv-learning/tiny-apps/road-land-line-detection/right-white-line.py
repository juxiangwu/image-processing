Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:

cv2.inRange() for color selection
cv2.fillPoly() for regions selection
cv2.line() to draw lines on an image given endpoints
cv2.addWeighted() to coadd / overlay two images cv2.cvtColor() to grayscale or change color cv2.imwrite() to output images to file
cv2.bitwise_and() to apply a mask to an image

Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!
